## Known Bugs <a name = "bugs"></a>

## Roadmap <a name = "roadmap"></a>

## Fixed Bugs <a name='fixed' id='fixed'></a>

### API get bug: Present on v2.5.0.4 <a name='api-bug' id='api-bug'></a>

## Status: FIXED on v2.5.0.5

- How we fixed: This Component did catch is the only way we were able to bypass polyfills and allow the api to run correctly.
  The way we have it is on initial load, we load the api from the loadZipCode api. Then we let it stay as an intial value which goes into the component did catch button click on submit. Then we update local storage, and value inputs to the api based call

### Polyfill Bug: Present on v2.5.0.4 <a name='polyfill' id='polyfill' ></a>

    ## Status: FIXED on v2.5.0.5

- Is tied with API bug but when we make api calls or use a library that uses react 5 or polyfills we need to make sure the library is updated, or need to figure out a work aroud.

### React Router Bug present on v.2.5.0.5 <a name='router-bug' id='router-bug'></a>

    ## Status: FIXED on v2.5.0.6

- How we fixed: React Router v6 is really functional based, 2.5 is writen component based. We reverted back to 5.3.1 version to utilize component based rendering and routes. Perhaps we may update once we come with a fix or a workaround to use v6.
